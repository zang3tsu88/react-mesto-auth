### Useful resouces

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) -Newer alternative to CRA.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

[Typograph](https://www.artlebedev.ru/typograf/) helps to put normal quotes (“Christmas trees” and “paws”) instead of inch signs, kill extra spaces, change hyphens to dashes in the right places, “attach” all short conjunctions and prepositions to the words following them with an inseparable space and produce a bunch other operations.

[TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) helps compress and optimize images.
